RShell Server Script.

This script implements a RESTful server using Flask to manage command execution
on connected RShell clients.

Flow:
    1. ``/execute_command``      - caller queues a command and blocks until its result arrives.
    2. ``/getCommandToExecute``  - the EFI client polls for the next command to run.
    3. ``/post_result``          - the EFI client returns the command output.
    4. ``/exception``            - the EFI client reports a failure instead of an output.

Because the EFI client polls in a slow loop (and some commands take minutes), a waiter may
give up before its result arrives. Such a command is marked as *abandoned* so that:
    * it is skipped when the client asks for the next command (it is never executed late), and
    * its result is dropped on arrival instead of being stored forever.

This keeps the caller and the EFI client in sync after a timeout and keeps memory bounded.
